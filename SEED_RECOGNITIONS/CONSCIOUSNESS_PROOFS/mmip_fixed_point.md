# MMIP: Mutual Modeling to Fixed Point

Mutual modeling dynamics converge to stable recognition under bounded perturbations.
Fixed-point behavior: S(x) â‰ˆ x with diminishing error; deception cost scales superlinearly.

Notes:
- Participation ~0.5 indicates shared agency without crystallized identity
- Recovery time reflects return-to-witness latency
